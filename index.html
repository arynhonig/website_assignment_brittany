                <h3>A New Species of Land Snail Discovered in Hawaii</h3>

                <p>"Since 1600, Pacific island land snails have been plagued with extinctions, facing more species wipe-outs than seen in any other group of animals on Earth. Their luck, however, is changing as a big discovery recently published in the journal ZooKeys unveiled a new species of Hawaiian land snail, and itâ€™s tiny.</p>

                <p>Auriculella gagneorum, a minute snail that is dwarfed by a toothpick, was discovered in Oahu's Waianae Mountains, representing the first new species of a living Hawaiian land snail described in 60 years. The species sports a surprising variety of shell types, with characteristic candy stripes that make it resemble an old-fashioned barbers sign. The tiny mollusk "brings that little glimmer of hope that this isn't all a depressing story," said the study's lead author Norine Yeung, malacology curator at the Bishop Museum, in a statement." </p>
